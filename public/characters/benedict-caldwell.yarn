Benedict Caldwell: Evening. I've been on the road a spell and wouldn't mind a place to bunk down for the night. A quiet room, if you have one â€“ walls can be too thin for an old soldier's liking.

You: Beg your pardon. Other than making conversation with guests, it's mostly cleaning and cooking. Just enjoying the best part of the day, chatting with the guests.

You: You'd have to walk through the night to get to the next inn. I'm the one asking questions here. Answer 'em, or take your chances on the road.

Benedict Caldwell: I didn't mean to come off so...
Benedict Caldwell: They don't teach manners in the service. I just arrived in Stonehearth a few days ago. I'm just looking for...
Benedict Caldwell: Kady Amertine, I think she would have been traveling from Stonehearth, same as me. Do you happen to know where she went? If not...
Benedict Caldwell: To be honest I'm not sure where to go from here.

You: Sorry, I can't say I remember a Kady Amertine. There's only 4 roads from here though.
You: Stonehearth is the port town you came from to the West.
You: To the north is Bramblewick. That's the biggest town around. Mix of all sorts of people up north. Closest thing we have to a big city.
You: To the East is Duskmire is mostly farms, and the people who work those farms. Then there's the people that own the farms with their big houses on the outside of town.
You: To the South is Moorfield. They're just doing the best they can with what they've got down there, which isn't much.
Benedict Caldwell: Well at least I have a little to go off of now. Thanks.

You: There's nary a way to be the only inn at this crossroads by making a point of telling anyone who traipeses through everyone else's business. I wouldn't tell you one way or the other. Just like I'd stay mum if some other traveler asked about your comings and goings.
Benedict Caldwell: I understand.
